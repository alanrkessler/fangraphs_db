Automating clicking the "Export Data" button on the FanGraphs Leaderboard is more difficult than other data sources. This repo contains some examples using Python and Selenium to scrape the data. 

As always, scraping data from the web may not be welcomed by the source and is important to keep in mind. This method is about as slow as a real person, so I feel it is a relatively good citizen.
